# Authentication.API

A simple authentication API built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) that supports user signup, signin, token refresh, and logout using JWT.

## üîê Overview

This authentication system includes multiple layers of security to ensure safe user management and token handling:

### ‚úÖ JWT Access and Refresh Tokens
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived JWTs signed using a secure secret. Used for authenticating API requests.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived tokens stored securely and used to obtain new access tokens without re-authentication.
- **Refresh Token Rotation**: Each refresh request issues a new token and invalidates the old one to prevent token reuse.
- **Secure Storage**: Hashed refresh tokens are stored in the database using `bcrypt` to prevent misuse in case of a database breach.

### ‚úÖ Input Validation and Sanitization
- All incoming requests are validated using `class-validator` and `class-transformer`.
- Prevents common injection attacks and malformed data submissions.

### ‚úÖ Rate Limiting
- rate limiting to sensitive routes (e.g., login) using `@nestjs/throttler` to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- rate limiting must also be applied at server level, but here it's used according to business needs.

### ‚úÖ Logging & Monitoring
- Secure logging implemented via **Winston**.

### ‚úÖ Password Security
- User passwords are hashed with `bcrypt` before being stored.
